# Team Profile Generator
## Project description
Have you ever needed quick way to create web profile of your team but couldn't do it yourself? Now you can! Using my simple app that asks simple questions about the team members you will be able to render a page containing 5 team members. The app itself uses classes, inquirer, number of tests and page template which, if additional members would need to be added, is written dynamically so you don't even have to to touch it.
